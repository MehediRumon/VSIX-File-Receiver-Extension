## 🔧 How to Test the Fixes

### Namespace Testing:
1. Enter root file name: `Student`
2. Check Configuration Info shows: `UMS.UI.Test.ERP.Areas.Student`
3. Check Locator Code has namespace wrapper
4. Check Method Code has namespace wrapper
5. Download files and verify namespace inclusion

### Format Testing:
1. Generate step file
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for debug messages about code length and line breaks
4. Copy generated code and check formatting in text editor
5. Download step file and verify formatting preservation

### Configuration Persistence Testing:
1. Set root file name and action name
2. Wait and watch if Configuration Info disappears
3. Check browser console for update messages
4. Note any timing when info disappears
