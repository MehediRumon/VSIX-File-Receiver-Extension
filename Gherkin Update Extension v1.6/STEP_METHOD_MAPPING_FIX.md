# Step Method Mapping Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The generated step file was using incorrect methods from the Method Code where steps should use their unique corresponding methods. For example:
- `WhenSelectAddDeviceCampus` was calling `page.GetAttendanceDeviceType()` instead of `page.GetCampus()`
- `WhenEnterAddDeviceName` was calling `page.GetAttendanceDeviceType()` instead of `page.GetName()`
- Multiple other similar incorrect mappings

## Root Cause
The `extractElementNameFromStep` function's similarity matching algorithm was not properly matching step text to the correct method names, often defaulting to the first or most frequently matched method name.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Method Matching Algorithm
- **Enhanced Word Extraction**: Added "add" and "device" to action words to filter them out
- **Better Scoring System**: Implemented exact matches (100 points), partial matches (50 points), and reverse partial matches (30 points)
- **Compound Word Matching**: Added logic to match compound words and substrings
- **Last Word Priority**: Added bonus scoring for matching the last word (often the field name)
- **Index Proximity Bonus**: Added slight preference for methods close in position to the step

### 2. Direct Index Mapping as Primary Strategy
- **Index-based Fallback**: When available, tries to map steps to methods by their index position first
- **Validation Check**: Verifies that direct index mapping makes logical sense before using it
- **Connection Verification**: Ensures there's some word overlap between step and method before accepting direct mapping

### 3. Improved Fallback Logic
- **Better Word Filtering**: Enhanced logic to remove menu/page prefixes while preserving field names
- **Entity Word Recognition**: Added recognition of common entity words like "device", "user", "student" to better extract field names
- **Pattern Recognition**: Improved handling of patterns like "Add Device Campus" to extract "Campus" as the field name
- **Special Case Handling**: Added support for compound actions like "Save And Exit"

### 4. Enhanced Debugging
- **Console Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to track the matching process
- **Score Reporting**: Shows matching scores and reasoning for each method candidate
- **Step Index Tracking**: Tracks which step is being processed for better debugging

## Key Changes in Code

### Function Signature Updates
```javascript
// Before
function extractElementNameFromStep(step)
function generateMethodFromStep(step, inputType, useMultiSelectHelper = false)

// After  
function extractElementNameFromStep(step, stepIndex = -1)
function generateMethodFromStep(step, inputType, useMultiSelectHelper = false, stepIndex = -1)
```

### Processing Loop Update
```javascript
// Before
for (const config of stepConfigurations) {
    const method = await generateMethodFromStep(config.step, config.inputType, multiSelectCount >= 2);
}

// After
for (let i = 0; i < stepConfigurations.length; i++) {
    const config = stepConfigurations[i];
    const method = await generateMethodFromStep(config.step, config.inputType, multiSelectCount >= 2, i);
}
```

## Expected Results
With these improvements, the step file generation should now correctly map:
- `When Select Add Device Campus "<Campus>"` → `page.GetCampus()`
- `When Enter Add Device Name "<Name>"` → `page.GetName()`
- `When Enter Add Device Port "<Port>"` → `page.GetPort()`
- `When Click On Add Device Save` → `page.GetSave()`
- `When Click On Add Device Save And Exit` → `page.GetSaveAndExit()`
