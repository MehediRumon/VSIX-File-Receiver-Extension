# Download Format Fix

## Issue Description
Previously, when downloading generated step files, the content would sometimes break into a single line, losing all formatting and making the files unreadable.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. Incorrect MIME type specification in the blob creation
2. Line ending inconsistencies across different operating systems
3. Browser cleanup happening too quickly before download completion

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Blob Creation
```javascript
// Before (problematic)
const blob = new Blob([content], { type: 'text/plain' });

// After (fixed)
const blob = new Blob([normalizedContent], { 
    type: 'text/plain;charset=utf-8' 
});
```

### 2. Line Ending Normalization
```javascript
// Normalize line endings for cross-platform compatibility
const normalizedContent = content.replace(/\r\n|\r|\n/g, '\r\n');
```

### 3. Better Download Handling
```javascript
// Improved cleanup timing
setTimeout(() => {
    document.body.removeChild(a);
    window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
}, 100);
```

## Benefits

1. **Preserved Formatting**: All indentation, line breaks, and code structure are maintained
2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works consistently on Windows, Mac, and Linux
3. **Reliable Downloads**: Reduced chance of download interruption or corruption
4. **Better File Quality**: Downloaded files are properly formatted and ready to use

## Files Affected

All download operations in the extension now use the improved download function:
- Element files (.cs)
- Page files (.cs)
- Step files (.cs)
- Feature files (.feature)
- Zip downloads (when downloading all files at once)

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. Generate some step files with the extension
2. Download any of the generated files
3. Open the downloaded file in a text editor
4. Confirm that:
   - All line breaks are preserved
   - Indentation is correct
   - Code structure is readable
   - No content is on a single line

## Technical Details

The fix ensures that:
- Content encoding is explicitly set to UTF-8
- Line endings are normalized to Windows format (\r\n) for maximum compatibility
- DOM cleanup happens with proper timing
- MIME type includes charset specification
